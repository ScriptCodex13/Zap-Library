# Contributing

So you want to contribute to this project ? That's great ! But we have to get the boring stuff done first.

## Requriments for making a Pull request 

Before you send us Pull Request be sure that it meets following requriments:

- Is your Pull request tested (doesn't have bugs) ?
- Does the Project build properly ?
- Is your Pull request able on run on different platforms and devices ?
- Does it change the coding style of the API or function names call orders etc. ? -> If so tell us about it and we will change it in the wiki
- You should also tell us, if you change something like dependencies ore core structures
- Be sure to document your changes and tell what you have changed exactly
- Your Pull request should only be for a specific segment (Graphics, GUI, Window, Util...)

## Coding style

It's important to keep the code in a consistent style so we came up with some requriments here.

1. Every call that is avaiable to the user should be callable from the zap namespace. Please be sure to use no other namespaces on top of it so the user doesn't have to call a endless list of namespaces. 
2. If you include new headers be sure to include them in the segments binding header
3. Be always sure to use relative paths when including other headers.
4. External dependencies like libraries should be included with <>
5. Use include guards in your headers
6. Every callable function for users of this software should be in capital letters.
   ex.: void MyFunction()
